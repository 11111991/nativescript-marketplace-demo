# See the NativeScript framework in Action
This is an app created by the NativeScript team to show the NativeScript framework in action. Run the app on your phone to explore the UX and performance that are delivered using cross platform JavaScript code.

You will find here the most common mobile use cases implemented - Data visualization, Data entry, Charting and native API access. The app contains samples that shows different nuts and bolts from the core NativeScript framework like layouts, buttons, animations and more.

The application also serves as a demo for the paid UI components created by Telerik called "UI for NativeScript".

You can use the application to see NativeScript in action, but also as learning purpose since the entire source code is available on GitHub.
